# SimpleBudgeting

This is a project that I started to learn more about overall application development.  This is all my own work and I am not following any tutorials.  My hope is to make a well functioniong app and then
make it much nicer looking UI.  

I ended up realizing that my code was unorganized and not scalable.  I want to finish this project, but I am taking a break and working on a tutorial that will allow me to make organized and scalable code. You can view my progress on TournamentTracker repository!
